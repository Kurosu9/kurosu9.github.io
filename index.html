                                My name is Kurstan. This is my portfolio. I am sometimes very nervous, shy and lazy.
                                But I am also hardworking, kind and talkative. My favourite color is blue. Because this color
                                best describes my character.

                                So, I was born in 23 august, 2003. Now I am studying at the University,
                                before that I studied at the Lyceum of Chyngyz Aitmatov.

                            <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
                            <p>
                                My education is secondary. I am pleased with this result.
                                My parents wanted me to study perfectly, but I am slow thinking
                                and the information comes to me late. If I hadn't tried, it would
                                seem that my GPA would have been much lower. So I'm happy with what
                                I have. Now I am studying at the Ala-Too University as a programmer.
                                Because I wrote before that one of my hobbies is video games. So I
                                want to understand how video games work and in the future, if I manage
                                to create my own game or application.

                                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Video games help me when I'm in a bad mood. When I play the game,
                                        I feel like I have separated from our world and entered another world.
                                        A video game is a place where I can relax and be myself. There are
                                        different genres of the game as in the series, but you decide for the 
                                        main character what to do first. It's very exciting and interesting. 
                                        Many people think that video games are a simple waste of time, but I
                                        think that this is one of the chances to understand and realize oneself.

                                    <p>
                                        I started to get involved in video editing when I started watching videos
                                        on YouTube. I was curious how they make such effects in the video and add
                                        cool music and I started watching different tutorials on it and what programs
                                        are needed for this. I edit only on the phone, because then I did not have
                                        a normal computer. And now I have, I think somehow learn how to mount on it.

                                <p>
                                    Watching your favorite series or new series is what most people enjoy, and
                                    so do I. Different serials have their own genre (comedy, psychology, fantasy,
                                    drama, detective melodrama, and etc), the plot that only it has and the name of
                                    the series itself.  Series are different there are TV series, animated series
                                    and anime. I sometimes watch TV series, but I love watching anime, many people 
                                    think that this is for children. This is not at all, the anime designed for 
                                    teenage and adult audiences. I used to also think that anime is not interesting, 
                                    but it turned out to be not like the proverb says "Don't judge a book by its cover." 
                                    The anime has interesting plots that are not in other series. Each series has its 
                                    own idea and zest from the authors and director.
