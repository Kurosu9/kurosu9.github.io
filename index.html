                            My name is Kurstan. This is my portfolio about me. I am sometimes very nervous, shy and lazy.
                            But I am also hardworking, kind and talkative. My favourite color is blue. Because this color
                            best describes my character.

                                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Video games help me when I'm in a bad mood. When I play the game,
                                    I feel like I have separated from our world and entered another world.
                                    A video game is a place where I can relax and be myself. There are
                                    different genres of the game as in the series, but you decide for the 
                                    main character what to do first. It's very exciting and interesting. 
                                    Many people think that video games are a simple waste of time, but I
                                    think that this is one of the chances to understand and realize oneself.

                                <h3>Video Editing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I started to get involved in video editing when I started watching videos
                                    on YouTube. I was curious how they make such effects in the video and add
                                    cool music and I started watching different tutorials on it and what programs
                                    are needed for this. I edit only on the phone, because then I did not have
                                    a normal computer. And now I have, I think somehow learn how to mount on it.

                                <h3>Series</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Watching your favorite series or new series is what most people enjoy, and
                                    so do I. Different serials have their own genre (comedy, psychology, fantasy,
                                    drama, detective melodrama, and etc), the plot that only it has and the name of
                                    the series itself.  Series are different there are TV series, animated series
                                    and anime. I sometimes watch TV series, but I love watching anime, many people 
                                    think that this is for children. This is not at all, the anime designed for 
                                    teenage and adult audiences. I used to also think that anime is not interesting, 
                                    but it turned out to be not like the proverb says "Don't judge a book by its cover." 
                                    The anime has interesting plots that are not in other series. Each series has its 
                                    own idea and zest from the authors and director.
