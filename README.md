>>### __PERFORMANCE TEST__ ###
>>## _I don't know why, but because of JavaScript and YouTube videos, the performance of the site is deteriorating. Without them, the performance was somewhere 95 higher on PC and on phones._ ##
### _This is my portfolio, I hope you like it because I tried very hard on it. For this portfolio as you can see I used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I divided my portfolio into 5 sections header, home, edu_and_bio, aboutme and contacts(footer)._ ###
